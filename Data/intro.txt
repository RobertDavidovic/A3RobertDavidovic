If you follow the train line south for long enough you will come across a peculiar place. It has been described as the Jewel of Melbourne, a hidden utopia only known to a select few. While not seeming impressive it has been a bastion of Australian Culture where everyone from all walks of life are welcome. 

Or once it used to be… for a plague has recently overcome this suburb, a plague of murder. Once every year, around September, 5 souls unfortunately pass due to what the press have labeled ‘The Frankston Ripper’.

The cycle begins anew this year, the ripper’s hibernation broken as they claimed their first victim of the year 3 nights ago. What could cause someone to go to such lengths??? Knowing Frankston, it’s probably meth. 

You’ve been transferred by the Dandenong detective force in an effort to solve this mystery. You’ve become Frankston’s last hope. Will you be the one to save this glorious suburb or will you allow four more souls to die…
